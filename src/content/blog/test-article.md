# Image Migration to Google Cloud Platform

Any type of software project can be difficult especially when it's a massive migration project. We were able to move all our image infrastructure from multiple environments to GCP in one and a half years.

## Background

At trivago, we handle millions of images daily for our hotel search platform. Our image infrastructure was spread across multiple environments and cloud providers.

## The Challenge

The migration wasn't just about moving files from one place to another. We had to consider:

### Technical Challenges

- **Scale**: Petabytes of image data across multiple regions
- **Availability**: Zero downtime during migration
- **Performance**: Maintaining or improving image load times

## Summary

The most important thing we learned is to plan properly and try our best to stick to it. If we fail to plan, we plan to fail.
